Instead of only one profile, you may also specify a list of profiles.  To later update your local copy of that profiles, you may run  instaloader --fast-update profile [profile ...]  If --fast-update is given, Instaloader stops when arriving at the first already-downloaded picture. When updating profiles, Instaloader automatically detects profile name changes and renames the target directory accordingly.  Instaloader can also be used to download private profiles. To do so, invoke it with  instaloader --login=your_username profile [profile ...]  When logging in, Instaloader stores the session cookies in a file in your temporary directory, which will be reused later the next time --login is given. So you can download private profiles non-interactively when you already have a valid session cookie file.
