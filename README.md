**Instaloader**

- downloads **public and private profiles, hashtags, user stories,
  feeds and saved media**,

- automatically **detects profile name changes** and renames the target
  directory accordingly,

- allows **fine-grained customization** of filters and where to store
  downloaded media.

How to Automatically Download Pictures from Instagram
-----------------------------------------------------

To **download all pictures and videos of a profile**, as well as the
**profile picture**, do

::

    instaloader profile [profile ...]

where ``profile`` is the name of a profile you want to download. Instead
of only one profile, you may also specify a list of profiles.

To later **update your local copy** of that profiles, you may run

::

    instaloader --fast-update profile [profile ...]

If ``--fast-update`` is given, Instaloader stops when arriving at the
first already-downloaded picture. When updating profiles, Instaloader
automatically **detects profile name changes** and renames the target directory
accordingly.

Instaloader can also be used to **download private profiles**. To do so,
invoke it with

::

    instaloader --login=your_username profile [profile ...]

When logging in, Instaloader **stores the session cookies** in a file in your
temporary directory, which will be reused later the next time ``--login``
is given.  So you can download private profiles **non-interactively** when you
already have a valid session cookie file.
